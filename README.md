# CMPSC 100-03 Lab Session 2: Code Poems
* Assigned: 9 September 2019
* Due: 16 September 2019
* Point value: 30 pts

In this laboratory session, we explore the Java Standard Library and begin to learn about creating more complex objects. In particular, this lab assesses:

* Creating an object with multiple `System.out.println` statements
* Understanding of the role and function of the `main` method in a Java `class`.
* Developing a working solution to an abstract request/"problem" statement

## General guidelines for laboratory sessions

* **Follow steps carefully.** Laboratory sessions often get a bit more complicated than their preceeding Practical sessions. Especially for early sessions which expose you to platforms with which you may not be familiar, take notes on `command`s you run and their corresponding effects/outputs. If you find yourself stuck on a step, let a TL or the professor know! Laboratory sessions do not mean that we won't help you in the same way we do during Practicals.
* **Regularly ask and answer questions.** Some of you may have more experience with the topics we're discussing than others. We can use this knowledge to our advantage. But, like in Practicals, let students try things for a while before offering help (**always _offer_ first**). To ask questions, use our [Slack](https://cmpsc100fall2019.slack.com)'s `#labs` channel.
* **Store and transfer files using GitHub.** Various forms of file storage are more or less volatile. *You* are responsible for backing up and storing files. If you're unsure of files which have been changed, you can always type `git status` in the terminal for your working folder to determine what you need to back up.
* **Keep all of your files.** See above, but also remember that you're responsible for the files you create.
* **Back up your files regularly.** See above (& above-above).
* **Review the [Honor Code](https://sites.allegheny.edu/about/honor-code/) reguarly when working.** If you're taking a solution from another student or the Internet at-large (_especially_ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)), bear in mind that using these solutions _can_ constitute a form of plagiarism that violates the Allegheny Honor Code. While it may seem easy and convenient to use these sources, it is equally easy and convenient to rely on them and create bad habits which include not attributing credit or relying exclusively on others to solve issues. Neither are productive uses of your intellect. Really.

## Further helpful reading for this assignment

If you have not already done so, I recommend reading the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com) which GitHub makes available. In particular, the guides:
* [Mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Documenting your projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)
* [GitHub Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
* GitHub handouts distributed at the beginning of the lab session

As for a markdown cheatsheet, [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) serves as a useful online, single-page guide.

## Required deliverables

A successful submission for this lab will include a Java program which:

* Compiles
* Runs successfully
* Contains a minimum of:
    * 1 multi-line comment containing each on a separate line, clearly labeled:
        * The title of the poem selected
        * The author of the poem selected
        * The source from which the poem was taken
    * **At Least** 10 `System.out.println` statements which contain individual lines of the work chosen that:
        * Display the title and author of work chosen, separated from the body of the poem by a blank line
        * Reproduce each line of the poem paying attention to spacing, syntax, and correct grammar
            * Keep in mind that "spacing" here means both horizontal and vertical spacing
        * Function as syntactically-correct Java statements
* A 250-word reflection included in a file named `reflection.md`, located in the main directory of your `commit`ted repository.

**Note**: Some poems contain italicized or otherwise-styled language. Though this is possible using Java, it is not a required part of the submission. However, students interested in achieving this formatting can read more formatting and non-printing characters in Java [in this Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30310147/how-to-print-an-string-variable-as-italicized-text).

If you do not have a poem in mind, you can always use [a poem I've selected](#the-naming-of-cats) for this assignment.
